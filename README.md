### QUICKSTART TO FITNESS

Fitness is great, though results can be slow to see. If you are choosing to pursue a fitness goal, find a routine that fits that goal and stick to it for the recommended cycle. 5x5 will get you stronger if you follow the routine for the recommended three months. Switching routines every other week will slow down progress. 

Diet plays a big part in fitness and can be extremely nuanced, but counting calories is a tried and true method. If the goal is to gain weight: Count calories. if you didnt gain weight in a weeks time, add more calories to your daily intake. The opposite is true for losing weight. Do research into fitness nutrition, mainly macro nutrients, if you want better and faster results.
